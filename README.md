Java Deck of Cards



This card game project was built using intellij and Java, it was a project designed to solidify my current Java knowledge and allow me to expand my learning further.

I started by creating a standard deck of cards which when a game was started would populate. I the proceeded to create the game Snap by extending the deckOfCards class.

To allow for user input and a functioning game I used a scanner, first to set the games players and secondly to allow the players to take their respective turns.

A feature which I am proud of in this game is the ability to be able to play as many times as you like and the ability to set players.

Some future work I would like to do on this project is implementing the players ability to call snap themselves so that if they miss the snap the game will continue, this will be done with the use of a timer meaning the player will only have a finite amount of time to snap the winning cards.

I would also like to further work on adding another game to fully demonstrate the re-usability of the deck of cards.
